# Circuit-Simulator
Simple electronic circuit simulator project. Intended to allow rapid prototyping of circuits to facilitate learning, ingenuity, and creativity. Also, it's fun!

This project will be written in Java. Then probably ported/re-written to/in C# to create a native Windows application.
